# Current architecture

Anne's Base currently contains a browser shell with keyboard customization, an
in-memory native table editor with table design, import and a transaction journal
with undo, a read-only SQL view, exports, a read-only SQLite viewer and synthetic
fixtures.
[ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md](ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md) describes the intended full product.

## Web scaffold

Vite bundles the TypeScript entry in `src/main.ts` and styles in `src/style.css`.
The application uses browser DOM APIs with no UI framework. `npm run dev` serves
the preview; `npm run build` type-checks and produces `dist/`. Node.js 24 LTS is
the recommended development version. The production web build includes an installable manifest and an offline service worker; the development server never registers it.

## Commands and views

`src/commands/registry.ts` loads metadata from `docs/commands-plan.json`. Each
planned command is registered once; a separate handler map controls whether it
can execute. Metadata alone never enables a command. Duplicate ids, unknown
handlers and duplicate handlers are rejected. Execution distinguishes unknown,
unavailable and executed commands; handler failures propagate to the caller.

`src/ui/shell.ts` renders a modern Office-style ribbon, search and the Quick
Access Bar from this catalog. Historic menus and their layout selector are
available in the collapsed Classic menus section. The Home ribbon uses the catalog's
special `homeTab` arrangement. Contextual tabs can be inspected in this preview;
they are not yet tied to an open object. Search matches all words against labels,
ids, tabs, groups and notes, and displays the first 60 matches. Text is inserted
through DOM text properties rather than HTML interpolation.

Search Commands, Add All Choices, New, Open/Open Read-Only, Save/Save As (download
a copy), Close Database, Create Table, New Record, Delete Record, Record History, Snapshots, Automatic Snapshots and Undo have handlers. Availability predicates disable
Save and Close without an open database and prevent overlapping file operations.
Sort Ascending/Descending/Clear, Filter, Apply/Toggle Filter, Clear All Filters and
Find delegate to the current table's view controls. Availability predicates disable
view commands without a selected table or while a file operation is in progress.
Pin, unpin, clear-pins, tab selection and menu selection are local shell controls.
Unimplemented commands are disabled. `src/ui/classicMenus.ts` renders all layouts
with native disclosure elements and buttons, keeping their browser accessibility
semantics. Arrow keys navigate menu levels and skip disabled actions, Home/End
select first/last choices, and type-ahead finds/cycles names. Enter/Space use
native activation; Escape/Left close levels, while Tab returns to the menu heading
before native focus traversal. Only one sibling branch opens at a time. Commands,
outside pointer actions and focus elsewhere close the menus without overriding
focus explicitly moved by an action. Menus/Menu Layout reveal and focus the
chooser through shared command bindings. Original historical key-map fidelity
and custom menu editing remain unverified/unimplemented respectively.

The menu controller removes its document listeners on disposal. Remounting a
shell disposes the previous menu and database controllers (including unload
guards) before replacing the DOM, preventing duplicate document handlers. Modern ribbon tabs support Left,
Right, Home and End keys with selected-tab state and associated panel labels.

`src/ui/backstage.ts` renders the Word-style File screen with a left navigation
rail and Home, New, Open, Info, Save, Print, Share, Export, Close and Options
pages. Its database actions use the same availability checks as the rest of the
shell. The workspace is hidden while File is open; Back or Escape restores it
and returns focus to File. Options can return to Command search to customize
Quick Access. The Home page shows an honest empty recent list, and Print shows
a placeholder rather than a fabricated preview.

## Preferences

`src/prefs.ts` stores versioned browser preferences under
`annesbase.preferences.v1`. Loading filters unknown command ids, removes duplicate
pins and validates menu layouts. Malformed JSON and unsupported versions fall
back to defaults. If browser storage cannot be read or written, controls continue
working for the session and saving failures are reported.

`QAT_STANDARD` and `QAT_EXTRAS` implement the choices in [QAT.md](QAT.md).
Add All Choices puts Save and Print first, sorts the remaining choices by label,
and appends other existing pins in their prior order. Any catalog command may be
pinned from search, including planned commands; pinning does not enable execution.
Separators, rearranging pins, per-database settings and cross-app
preference-format compatibility are not implemented yet.

Preferences may also hold `keys`, a map from canonical shortcut text to a command
id (assign) or `null` (remove a catalog default); it is omitted when empty.
`exportSettings`/`importSettings` wrap preferences in a versioned
`annes-base-settings` JSON file; import runs the same normalization, so unknown
commands, invalid shortcuts and layouts are dropped rather than trusted.

## Keyboard

`src/keyboard.ts` canonicalizes shortcut text (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Key`; Meta/Cmd is
treated as Ctrl) and keyboard events (physical letter, digit and punctuation keys,
so Ctrl+Shift+; is stable; a typed plus is `Ctrl++`). Effective bindings are the
catalog shortcuts, first command winning on a shared key, with overrides applied.
One document listener per shell dispatches a key only when its command is
available, and calls `preventDefault` only then. In inputs, text areas, selects
and editable content, unmodified keys, Esc and native editing chords (Ctrl+A/C/V/X/Z/Y,
word navigation) are never captured. `src/ui/keyboardSettings.ts` provides the
Customize Keyboard panel; its capture box stops propagation so recording a key
never runs a command.

## SQLite and files

`src/engine/database.ts` wraps sql.js (MIT; SQLite is public domain). The WASM is
loaded lazily by `src/engine/browser.ts` from Vite's emitted assets, without a
runtime CDN. The sql.js license is bundled in `public/licenses/sql.js.txt`.

New files contain `qb_meta` with application `annes-base` and schema version
`2-preview`; this is an experimental catalog, not the final native format. The
sample adds Customers and Orders with fictional data (relationships are not enforced).
The old `0-preview` catalog remains readable without a silent migration. Native metadata is hidden
from table navigation only when the application and version markers match.
Supported `1-preview` files remain editable. Their metadata moves to `2-preview`
in the same transaction as the first selective restore. Failed restores roll
back this marker too; schema structure is unchanged. Older app builds cannot
edit the new format or interpret its restore journal operation.

Opening validates the SQLite signature and `PRAGMA quick_check(1)` before
replacing the current session. Failed opens leave the previous database intact.
All sessions idle with `PRAGMA query_only = ON`; native mutations temporarily
enable writes only inside the journal's transaction layer. The wrapper exposes no
arbitrary SQL interface. Existing file bytes are never written. Export restores
the query-only pragma because sql.js resets connection settings on export.

`src/ui/databasePane.ts` owns the session and displays table names, columns and
pages of 100 rows with one lookahead row. Names are quoted, values use
DOM text nodes, integers are read as BigInt, nulls are marked and blobs show their
byte count. Text displays are shortened after 2,000 characters without modifying
stored data. Table-view sorting and filtering run in SQLite before paging.

Files are loaded into memory with a 32 MiB input limit. This is not a worker/OPFS
engine, large-file implementation or encryption layer.
The browser file picker reads a copy; Save/Save As triggers a separate download
and does not imply the download completed or replace an existing file. Browser
autosave preserves committed native state for explicit restoration after reload.
Closing/replacing a database and beforeunload guard mutations not yet autosaved
or requested for download, and unfinished form drafts. A started download is
explicitly described as a request, not a confirmed save.

## Native editing and journal

`src/engine/journal.ts` accepts only managed native tables: an automatic integer
id and 1–32 Text, Integer, Real, Boolean (Yes/No) or Date fields. Boolean columns
carry `CHECK (x IN (0, 1))` and Date columns `CHECK (x IS date(x))`, so only real
`YYYY-MM-DD` dates are stored. Metadata (`qb_objects.fields_json`) must
reconstruct the exact table SQL before writes are allowed. Internal schemas are
checked on open; any trigger disables all native editing. Ordinary SQLite and
unsupported native schemas stay read-only. Required means SQL NOT NULL; empty
strings remain distinct from null. Whole numbers are validated against the signed
64-bit range and bound as decimal strings to avoid JavaScript number rounding.

Each create/insert/update/delete runs in an IMMEDIATE transaction, including its
`qb_journal` entry. Row images encode integer values as tagged decimal strings.
If the data write or journal write fails, both roll back. The sample is baseline
data, not user history. Undo processes the newest active entry, restores before
values or a deleted row (or drops an empty newly created table), and marks the
entry undone in the same transaction. Before reversing insert/update, the current
row must still match the after image. Malformed history and conflicting restores
stop without partial changes. A new change after undo starts a new history branch;
redo is not offered. The journal is part of the downloaded database.

`src/ui/editors.ts` provides a field-list form and record forms with explicit null
controls. Edits are committed on Save record, not per keystroke. Selection enables
Edit/Delete; change history shows the latest 100 entries. Foreign-key design,
arbitrary SQLite writes and as-of views remain planned.

### Table redesign and import (`3-preview`)

`alterTable(table, changes)` takes the complete new field list, each entry naming
the existing field whose values it keeps (or `null` for a new, empty field). Kept
fields may be renamed, reordered or change Required, but not type. In one IMMEDIATE
transaction the journal stores the old field list plus every non-null value of each
removed field, the table is renamed to the reserved `qb_rebuild`, recreated from
canonical SQL, filled with `INSERT … SELECT`, and the temporary table dropped; the
catalog row is updated and a single `alterTable` event written. A NOT NULL failure
rolls everything back with an explanation. Undo verifies the current design and
that added fields are still empty, rebuilds to the previous design with removed
fields relaxed, writes their journaled values back by id, then restores their
Required setting.

`importTable(name, fields, records)` validates every value with the same field
parser as record forms, creates the table and inserts ids 1…n with one prepared
statement, and writes one `importTable` event recording the field list and count.
Undo drops the table only if its field list, count and id range still match.

Two boundaries separate history: the lifetime boundary (last active `createTable`
or `importTable`) keeps record ids from being reused; the design boundary (any
schema event) limits record history and selective restore to images that use the
current field list. Creating a Yes/No or Date field, redesigning or importing sets
`schema_version` to `3-preview` in the same transaction; selective restore only
upgrades `1-preview` to `2-preview`, never downgrades. Builds that predate
`3-preview` open such files read-only.

## SQL view, export and relationships

`src/engine/sqlQuery.ts` splits SQL into statements lexically (comments, string
literals and all four identifier quotings are skipped) **before anything is
prepared**. This matters because SQLite applies flag pragmas such as
`query_only` while a statement is prepared, so preparing an unchecked second
statement could switch off read-only mode. Exactly one statement beginning with
SELECT, WITH or VALUES is accepted; `PRAGMA query_only` is verified to be on
before and after preparation and reasserted afterwards, so a WITH … DELETE is
still refused by SQLite. Rows are read with `useBigInt`; reading stops after
1,000 rows. EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN is prepended only by the app. `src/ui/sqlView.ts`
renders results, plans, a 50-entry session history and CSV download.

`src/engine/exchange.ts` contains an RFC 4180 parser with delimiter detection,
conservative type inference (leading-zero codes and out-of-range integers stay
text), name de-duplication, a JSON-array planner, and writers for CSV/TSV, JSON
(integers written digit-for-digit), HTML, XML (field names as attributes, blobs
in base64) and SQL scripts (round-trippable REAL literals, `X'…'` blobs, generated
columns omitted, virtual tables skipped). `DatabaseSession.exportData` returns
every row of the current view; `sqlScript` exports user objects only, so the
native catalog and journal are not included. `relationships()` groups
`PRAGMA foreign_key_list` rows per constraint. `src/ui/importPanel.ts` previews
imports (nothing is written before confirmation) and draws the relationships
list and SVG diagram.

## Record history and selective restoration

`recordHistory()` validates and decodes per-record before/after images in pages
of 50 entries, with a lookahead. It includes undone entries for inspection and
returns an optimistic token representing the current complete row (or absence).
The UI compares field values and permits restoration only of a non-absent image.
Long display values are shortened without changing the restored data.

`restoreVersion()` validates table/record/event ownership, checks the preview
token and the current row's consistency with active history, then inserts or
updates the chosen image and appends a `restore` event in one transaction. It
never reactivates older events. Global Undo reverses this event using its own
before image, including returning a recovered record to an absent state.
Unrelated rows and their history are preserved. Malformed images, stale previews,
external row changes and journal-write failures stop without partial writes.

Automatic inserts choose one more than the largest current or historic record
id in the current table lifetime, including undone history, and fail on 64-bit
exhaustion. Restoring the original id is allowed because it restores that same
record rather than allocating a new identity. Legacy files with multiple insert
events for one id are ambiguous and cannot selectively restore that id. The
latest active create-table event bounds each table lifetime, so drop/recreate
cannot expose earlier incarnations for restoration. Baseline versions that were
never journaled are not synthesized.

`src/ui/recordHistory.ts` offers an id picker, before/after review, older-page
loading and restore actions. The pane closes on successful mutations, database
changes and table/view changes. Restore refreshes the data view and participates
in browser autosave. Per-record history is limited to supported editable native
schemas; related-record restoration, actor metadata and bulk/as-of workflows
are not provided yet.

## Table views

`src/engine/tableView.ts` compiles a flat group of up to eight typed conditions, an optional
literal find term and up to five sort priorities into a read-only SELECT. All/Any
map to fixed AND/OR operators inside parentheses; Find always intersects the
complete group. The original single-sort/single-filter API remains supported,
but mixing old and new forms is rejected. Duplicate sort columns, excessive
levels/conditions, unknown columns and invalid group operators are rejected.
Columns come from
`PRAGMA table_xinfo` (including visible generated columns). Identifiers are
catalog-validated and quoted; operators/directions use fixed allowlists and
all search/filter values are bound parameters. Integer comparisons validate
the signed 64-bit range and bind decimal strings, avoiding JavaScript rounding.

Text contains/find uses SQLite `instr(lower(CAST(... AS TEXT)), lower(?))`;
case folding is ASCII-only and wildcard characters are literal. Numeric
conditions use declared SQLite affinity; untyped columns use text comparisons.
Blob fields permit null checks and are excluded from Find. General sorting
retains SQLite's storage-type, collation and null-ordering behavior.

Paging fetches 100 rows plus one lookahead. Default/tie order is the declared
primary key, including composite keys; tables without one use visible columns.
This provides repeatable page boundaries without exposing arbitrary SQL. It is
not a query designer, arbitrary SQL editor or large-data virtual grid.

`src/ui/tableControls.ts` renders dynamic sort/condition rows, All/Any matching,
literal Find and an explicit Apply view action. Sort levels can be reordered or
removed; filter conditions can be removed individually. The advanced sort and
filter commands focus these controls. Ascending/Descending modifies the first
sort priority while retaining applied secondary levels, Remove Sort clears every key, and
the filter toggle/clear commands act on the entire group. All conditions are
validated even when the group is disabled. Nested groups, saved query objects and
custom value-list sorting remain future work. Invalid filters leave the current view intact. Applied view
changes reset pagination and record selection and respect unfinished editor
drafts. Editing uses the selected primary-key id, so sorting or a filter that
hides an edited row cannot redirect the write. View state is not journaled,
autosaved or written into the database; table changes and restore reset it.

## Datasheet totals

`src/engine/totals.ts` compiles the same validated/bound WHERE expression as
ordinary table views and runs read-only SQLite aggregates across the complete
matching result. Neither page LIMIT/OFFSET nor sort order changes the total.
Record count includes all matching rows; per-column Count excludes NULL. Empty
sum/average/min/max results remain NULL and display as a dash. Supported operation
choices depend on declared column kind; identifiers are catalog-validated and
quoted, and aggregate names come from a fixed mapping.

COUNT and integer SUM/MIN/MAX are read with BigInt. Integer overflow is reported
per column, leaving matching-record count and other totals available. Numeric
SUM/AVG first reject nonnumeric non-NULL stored values rather than accept
SQLite's implicit conversion of text to zero. Nonfinite numeric results are also
reported. Average and floating-point sums use SQLite arithmetic and are marked
approximate. Text minimum/maximum follows the current SQLite storage types and
collations. Standard deviation and variance use the sample (n − 1) formula in
two passes (COUNT/AVG, then the sum of squared deviations with the mean bound as
a parameter), avoiding the cancellation error of AVG(x²) − AVG(x)²; fewer than two
values give NULL. Totals are not grouped queries.

`src/ui/totalsRow.ts` renders column selectors and results in a native table
footer, with a full-result count and explanatory text. Long text/blob displays
follow the viewer's bounded display convention. `databasePane.ts` binds
`record.totals` to the workspace toggle and caches results by committed mutation
revision, effective view and choices, so paging does not rescan the table. Writes
invalidate the cache; switching session/table clears choices and hides the row.
Changing a total or toggling the footer rerenders only the datasheet, preserving
unfinished record forms and unapplied sort/filter controls. Uncommitted forms
are excluded. Totals never add history, autosave writes or database changes, and
are not currently included in saved view presets or downloads.

## Saved browser view library

`src/storage/savedViews.ts` uses independent IndexedDB database
`annesbase.views.v1`. Each versioned entry contains a bounded, canonical view
definition, table/column metadata, source file name, name and revision. It stores
no SQLite bytes or SQL statements. The compiler validates every definition,
including disabled filters, and reads reject unsupported/corrupt versions.
Canonicalization strips unknown properties and converts the legacy single-sort/
single-filter API into the current array/group form. The library is limited to
200 definitions, each at most 256 KiB, with names of 1–80 characters.

Compatibility compares table name and ordered column names, declared types,
primary-key positions and inferred kinds. This is a column-layout match, not a
database identity or SQL-schema/collation comparison. It intentionally permits
explicit reuse across matching native and read-only files. Source filenames are
annotations. A unique index enforces case-insensitive names per layout; revisions
are checked inside write transactions before replacement/deletion. Conflicts,
quota failures and duplicate names leave previous definitions intact. Recovery
and snapshot stores do not need migration and are never changed by this library.

`src/ui/savedViews.ts` saves only the applied view; unsubmitted table-control
changes and unfinished record drafts are excluded. Loading re-reads the selected
entry, checks its revision and column layout, and validates the SQL against the
current session before using the existing pending-draft guard. A late read cannot
apply to another database/table. The current active view resets on table/file
changes; presets never load automatically. Rename/replacement uses the explicit
Replace button, and removal leaves the applied view and records untouched.
Other-table/incompatible entries can be shown for library cleanup. Refresh is
explicit, and disposal invalidates asynchronous UI callbacks. Pending library
writes retain the leave-page guard; success is shown only after commit.

Saved presets stay in browser profile/origin storage, including while offline.
They include literal filter/search values and are not embedded in downloads,
recovery copies or snapshots. Export/import, query objects, grouping, hidden
fields and column ordering are not included in this feature.

## Browser autosave and recovery

`src/storage/recovery.ts` uses IndexedDB database `annesbase.recovery.v1` with
separate metadata and byte stores. Metadata and SQLite bytes commit in the same
transaction. Every document gets a UUID; starting/opening another native file
creates a separate recovery copy instead of replacing the previous one. Listing
copies reads metadata without loading all database bytes. There is no automatic
pruning; inactive copies can be explicitly removed.

Each update and removal compares the expected revision inside its read/write
transaction. Stale tabs fail without overwriting/deleting a newer version. The
local session is retained on failure, and the current newer copy can be restored
after resolving pending edits. This is conflict detection, not live multi-tab
synchronization or merging. The list refreshes on launch and local storage actions.

`src/storage/autosave.ts` serializes writes for a document and coalesces pending
snapshots to the newest one while a write is in flight. It exports a consistent
SQLite image after each committed mutation, on editable-native creation/open,
and when download acknowledgement changes. An older completion cannot report a
newer edit as saved. Quota/availability/conflict errors keep an error state until
a successful retry or restoration. Recovery bytes are limited to 32 MiB.

`databasePane.ts` restores saved files only when requested, validates them with
the existing SQLite open path, and reconnects autosave to their id/revision. The
recorded pending-download flag is restored separately from SQLite history, so
undo remains available and download status is not silently lost. Ordinary,
legacy and explicitly read-only opens do not autosave. Unfinished form drafts
are never serialized; they retain their unload guard even if committed rows
have been saved. A confirmed browser save makes leaving committed rows safe
without a download prompt, but is not a portable backup.

IndexedDB is scoped to browser profile/origin and can be cleared or evicted.
This store provides latest-state recovery; separate stores provide versioned
snapshots and offline app files. It does not sync devices, save directly to the
original file or provide a worker/OPFS SQLite engine.

## Versioned browser snapshots

`src/storage/snapshots.ts` uses a separate IndexedDB database,
`annesbase.snapshots.v1`, leaving latest-state recovery storage unchanged. Metadata
and complete SQLite bytes commit atomically. Snapshot ids use add-only inserts;
concurrent tabs cannot overwrite an existing version. Listing reads metadata only.
SHA-256 checksums (Web Crypto, HTTPS/localhost) and byte sizes are checked on read;
restoration also uses the normal SQLite signature, integrity and catalog checks.
Checksums detect corruption, not malicious alteration of browser storage.

Manual versions are pinned until explicitly removed. Optional automatic captures
export before a mutation and enqueue only after it succeeds. A serialized queue
coalesces pending automatic captures per document while retaining every manual
request. Each automatic transaction prunes older automatic versions for that
document to the configured count (1–20), preserving manual versions and other
documents. A failed byte write rolls back both metadata and pruning. Retention
changes take effect on the next automatic save, not immediately.

`src/ui/snapshots.ts` provides labels, metadata browsing, current/all-document
scope, download, removal and restore as a separate copy. The copy gets a new
recovery UUID; the original snapshot and recovery copy remain unchanged. Its
journal and undo remain available. Captures do not include unfinished drafts;
restore uses pending-edit protection and validates a candidate before replacing
the workspace. Snapshot failures do not block edits or claim autosave success.
Pending snapshot writes retain the leave-page warning. Errors are visible even
if the panel was closed. UI callbacks stop updating after disposal, while queued
writes of already captured bytes can finish independently.

Opt-in settings use `annesbase.snapshots.settings.v1`, separate from shell
preferences; unavailable localStorage falls back to session-only settings with a
warning. Each SQLite image is limited to 32 MiB. Snapshots remain browser/origin
storage and are not embedded in the native file. No timed/on-close snapshots,
age retention, sync, encryption or worker/OPFS snapshots are implemented yet.

## Installable offline web build

`vite.config.ts` uses a relative base so production files can be served at the
origin root or a subdirectory. `public/manifest.webmanifest` declares a scoped,
standalone app with the existing branding rasterized at 192 and 512 pixels;
`resources/install-icons.json` records its source hash and provenance. Install
availability depends on browser/platform support and secure hosting.

`scripts/offline-build.ts` hashes the final build output (HTML, CSS, all JS including the
lazy SQLite loader, WASM, public manifest/icons and license). It emits `sw.js`
from `src/pwa/service-worker.js`, with a content version covering both the file
manifest and worker template. `scripts/check-offline.mjs` runs after every build
to verify file digests, SQLite inclusion, relative paths and installation assets.
There are no runtime CDN dependencies or extra service-worker packages.

Installation fetches every file with SHA-256 Subresource Integrity, no HTTP cache
and no redirects. Partial downloads, mixed deployments and HTML fallbacks for
missing files fail installation and discard only the new incomplete cache.
There is no `skipWaiting` or automatic reload. A waiting update activates after
all old clients close, then removes older app caches only for its exact scope.
Other scopes/apps and IndexedDB databases are untouched. Servers should serve
`sw.js` with revalidation/no-cache and upload a complete build together; old
hashed assets should remain available while clients finish updating.

Fetch interception is restricted to GET requests for the exact precache allowlist
and the app's root/index navigation (query strings on the entry are supported).
Known files use cache-first responses by their canonical verified URL, so
static-server Vary: Origin headers cannot cause module requests to miss the
precache solely because they carry different Origin headers. Other navigations, APIs, database files,
external requests and non-GET requests retain ordinary network behavior. No user
database bytes enter the service-worker cache or background upload queue.

`src/pwa/offline.ts` registers only in production on a secure origin, displays
verified cache readiness via MessageChannel, tracks online/offline state, handles
a user-triggered browser installation prompt and exposes explicit update checks.
Waiting updates explain that all app windows must close; drafts are never
silently reloaded. A missing-cache retry refetches integrity-checked files into
the active version without deleting good files on failure. If that old version
is no longer available on the server, it cannot be fabricated: the user must
complete the new update online. Status queries time out visibly, and listeners
are removed on disposal/HMR. Browser eviction and first-ever offline visits
remain practical limits; installing does not make user storage a portable backup.

Native packaging, public deployment, cross-device sync and background database
uploads are not implemented by this feature.

## Validation

- vitest checks registry behavior, catalog coverage, all menu/ribbon references,
  preference validation, choice ordering, SQLite views, journals, recovery storage
  and DOM interactions using jsdom. Tests use at most two workers to avoid
  WebAssembly/jsdom resource contention on smaller runners.
- Python standard-library tests verify generated SQLite fixtures and damage
  detection; see [../tests/corpus/README.md](../tests/corpus/README.md).
- `scripts/gen-plan.py --check` validates the planning sources.
- GitHub Actions runs Python checks on Linux/Windows and the web tests/build on
  Linux. Pushing a `v*` tag that matches `package.json` runs `release.yml`, which
  tests, builds and publishes a GitHub prerelease containing the zipped `dist/`
  and its SHA-256 checksum. Native platform installers are not configured.
