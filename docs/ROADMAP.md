# Roadmap

> **In progress: M1 native editor, with the first M2 tools.** The browser shell supports native table creation and redesign, five field types, record editing, transactional history, sequential undo, browser autosave/restore, CSV/JSON import and export, a read-only SQL view and keyboard customization, plus read-only SQLite browsing. Worker/OPFS storage, validation/index/lookup design, query design and native platform packaging remain unfinished. Milestones are ordered by dependency, not by date. The release goal for each milestone from M1 on is a tagged prerelease built for every platform; tagged web prereleases are implemented, Android/iOS/desktop builds are not. Command ids refer to [COMMANDS-PLAN.md](COMMANDS-PLAN.md).

## M0 — Planning (this repository)

- [x] README, feature survey ([INNOVATIONS.md](INNOVATIONS.md)), command inventory ([COMMANDS-PLAN.md](COMMANDS-PLAN.md), generated from [commands-plan.src.txt](commands-plan.src.txt)), classic menu layouts ([MENUS-PLAN.md](MENUS-PLAN.md)), Quick Access Bar plan ([QAT.md](QAT.md)), AI plan ([AI-PLAN.md](AI-PLAN.md)), formats ([FORMATS-PLAN.md](FORMATS-PLAN.md)), recovery ([RECOVERY-PLAN.md](RECOVERY-PLAN.md)), code ([CODE-PLAN.md](CODE-PLAN.md)), architecture ([ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md](ARCHITECTURE-PLAN.md)), legal notes, license, contributing guide and issue templates.
- [x] `scripts/gen-plan.py` validates ids, menu references, origins and shortcut conflicts.
- [x] Planning-stage CI validates plans, metadata and the synthetic corpus on Linux and Windows with Python 3.10 and 3.13; checks Termux setup script syntax on Linux. Application builds and release workflows remain in M1.
- [ ] Verify the classic menu arrangements and default keys against installed copies or published manuals of Access 2003 and current Access, dBASE III Plus and IV, FoxPro 2.6 for DOS, Visual FoxPro 9, Paradox 4.5 for DOS and Paradox for Windows, FileMaker Pro, Lotus Approach 97, Works, LibreOffice Base, SSMS and DBeaver, and correct [menus-plan.src.txt](menus-plan.src.txt).
- [ ] Collect an openly licensed test corpus: databases from each program in FORMATS-PLAN.md (made for the project or redistributable), and generated damaged files.
  - [x] Synthetic SQLite seed corpus: intact relational data, damaged header, damaged secondary index and truncation; provenance, logical ground truth and read-only validation tests. See [tests/corpus/README.md](../tests/corpus/README.md).
  - [ ] Add Access, xBase, Paradox and other format samples, WAL/journal damage and recovery-score assertions as their readers arrive.
- [ ] Confirm the license of every on-device model candidate in AI-PLAN.md and of the optional DuckDB module.
  - [x] Declared licenses of the runtimes and optional module confirmed from their package registry entries (DuckDB-WASM MIT, ONNX Runtime Web MIT, Transformers.js Apache-2.0); see [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md#license-verification).
  - [ ] AI-PLAN.md names no specific model weights yet; each chosen model's license must be checked when it is selected.

## M1 — Shell, engine and tables

- Project scaffold: TypeScript, Vite, vitest, Capacitor 8 (Android, iOS), Electron, PWA manifest and service worker; CI and release workflows from the sister apps.
  - [x] TypeScript/Vite browser entry, vitest, lockfile and web validation CI (`npm ci`, tests, type check and production build).
  - [x] Installable web manifest/icons, production-only service worker with integrity-checked editor/SQLite precache, offline readiness/repair, install prompt and update status; updates wait for all clients to close and preserve IndexedDB user data. Relative deployment paths and offline editing are browser-verified.
  - [x] Tag-triggered release workflow: tests, production build, version/tag check and a GitHub prerelease with the zipped offline web build and SHA-256 checksum.
  - [ ] Capacitor and Electron projects and their release jobs. Public web hosting/deployment is not configured.
- Suite shell: command registry, ribbon, Quick Access Bar with **Add All Choices** (`view.qatAddAll`), Customize Ribbon and Keyboard, command search, Backstage, preferences, settings import/export, portable mode.
  - [x] Registry for every planned command, search, ribbon groups, Quick Access pin/unpin/clear, standard and extra choices with Save/Print first, and browser-persisted pins/menu selection. Execution requires a real handler; unimplemented commands stay unavailable.
  - [x] Modern Office-style ribbon tabs with keyboard navigation and Word-style File/Backstage navigation; database actions stay unavailable until implemented.
  - [x] Keyboard shortcuts from the catalog run available commands, with text-field protection; Customize Keyboard assigns, moves, removes and resets shortcuts; Export/Import Settings writes and validates a portable settings file; File ▸ Options links them. Backstage New/Open/Save/Export/Close actions work.
  - [ ] Custom ribbon tabs, broader preferences and portable mode; integrate suite shell conventions as features arrive.
- **Classic menu bar** with the Access 2003 layout (default) and View ▸ Menus.
  - [x] Render all 15 planned layouts and nested menus with a layout selector; default to Access 2003 style.
  - [x] Menus/Menu Layout commands reveal the chooser; all 15 layouts support arrow/Home/End navigation, nested submenus, type-ahead, native Enter/Space activation, Escape/Tab and outside-focus/pointer dismissal. Disabled actions are skipped and command-directed focus is preserved.
  - [ ] Verify historical arrangements and original shortcut fidelity (M0); custom menu editing remains future work.
- Storage engine: SQLite WASM, `.qbase` catalog, **journal**, snapshots, encryption.
  - [x] Locally bundled SQLite WASM, experimental `0-preview` native metadata, blank/sample creation, checked read-only file opening and copy download; 32 MiB in-memory input limit.
  - [x] Experimental `1-preview` managed-table catalog and transactional before/after journal; sequential undo survives download/reopen. Ordinary/old/unsupported database schemas remain read-only.
  - [x] `2-preview` selective-restore events, no automatic record-id reuse, stale-preview/journal-consistency checks and transactional upgrade of supported `1-preview` files on first selective restore.
  - [x] IndexedDB recovery copies for each editable native database, atomic metadata/byte writes, reload restoration with undo history, serialized/coalesced autosaves, stale-tab revision checks and visible storage-error retry.
  - [x] Versioned IndexedDB snapshots: labeled pinned manual versions, opt-in before-change captures, per-document automatic retention, atomic pruning, checksum verification, copy restore/download and shared command bindings.
  - [x] `3-preview` catalog: table redesign (`alterTable`) and bulk import (`importTable`) each commit as one journal event that undoes completely, including removed field values.
  - [ ] Worker/OPFS and platform storage, finalized object catalog, general transaction grouping for arbitrary multi-step operations, scheduled snapshots/age retention and encryption.
- Navigation pane and Database window; Table Datasheet and Design views with every field type, properties, validation, indexes, lookups; record commands, sort and filter (selection, form, advanced), find and replace, totals row.
  - [x] Table navigation and read-only datasheet pages, preserving integer precision and displaying nulls/blobs safely.
  - [x] Basic table creation (Text, Whole number, Decimal number, non-null fields, automatic integer primary key), record insert/update/delete, null controls and sequential undo; pending-edit and draft guards.
  - [x] Single-column sort, typed column filters, NULL conditions, literal find across text/numbers, filter toggle/clear, stable paged ordering and shared command bindings; works on read-only SQLite too.
  - [x] Multi-column sorting with up to five ordered priorities, reordering/removal, and up to eight typed filter conditions combined with All/Any; literal Find intersects the complete group. Shared advanced command bindings, whole-group toggle/clear, stable paging and draft guards work on native and read-only files.
  - [x] Named browser view presets preserve applied sort/filter/Find/toggle settings, with explicit loading, replace/rename/remove, schema compatibility checks, cross-tab revision protection, visible storage errors and read-only/offline reuse. Presets remain separate from native files.
  - [x] Read-only totals row: full filtered-result record count and per-column Count/Sum/Average/Minimum/Maximum, exact integer handling, explicit overflow/type errors, paging cache and refresh after edits/undo/view changes. Works with native and read-only files.
  - [x] Design view for existing native tables: add, remove, rename and reorder fields and change Required, journaled with exact undo; Yes/No and Date field types with CHECK constraints and a date filter kind.
  - [x] Sample standard deviation and variance totals (two-pass).
  - [ ] Remaining field types (currency, date/time, long text, attachment, calculated…), field type conversion, validation/index/lookup designers, virtualized large-data grids, custom sort lists, nested condition groups, saved query objects, saved totals settings and the remaining record commands.
- Undo Delete, Record History, Show Table as of (the journal's first uses).
  - [x] Global Undo restores deletions and previous row values; the latest 100 journal entries are visible in Change history.
  - [x] Per-record before/after history with older-page loading, deleted-record id lookup and selective restore as a new undoable change; history and restore survive download/reload.
  - [ ] Actor attribution, related-record and bulk restoration, as-of table views and the full Undo Delete workflow.
- [x] A catalog test comparing the registry with `docs/commands-plan.json`, including every menu, ribbon and Home-tab reference. This checks registration coverage, not implementation of every planned command.

## M2 — Queries and relationships

  - [x] Read-only SQL view: single SELECT/WITH/VALUES statements checked lexically before preparation, exact integers, 1,000-row results, explain plan, formatter, session history and CSV download of results.
  - [ ] Journaled write statements, transactions, cancellation (needs a worker), dialects and Translate SQL.
- Import and export: CSV/text with specs, spreadsheets, JSON, XML, HTML, SQLite, SQL scripts; Open in Anne's Grid.
  - [x] Import CSV/tab/semicolon/bar-delimited text and JSON arrays as a new native table with type inference, editable field names/types and a single undoable journal event.
